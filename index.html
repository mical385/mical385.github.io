	<p>
		Well,I have put in a crypto miner using javascript,running right inside in your browser.
		As you can see,you have fallen into my trap of visiting my website,stranger!(I wondered who took the personal care of visiting my website?)
		You guys can go to <a href="https://github.com/mical385/mical385.github.io/blob/main/index.html">my website source code</a> to view my awesome source code
    		After that,you guys can go <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ"> to this youtube video</a> explaining how to use it.
		cheers!
